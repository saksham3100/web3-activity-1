# Web3 Activity – Voting Contract Assignment

## 📌 Overview
In this assignment, you will create a **Voting Smart Contract**, deploy it on any Ethereum test network using Remix (preferably using MetaMask), and submit your work through a Pull Request (PR) on GitHub.  
You will also create a folder named **with your roll number** inside your respective branch.

---

## 🧾 Task Requirements

### ✅ 1. Create a Voting Smart Contract
Your smart contract should include at least the following features:

- Ability to add candidates  
- Ability to vote for a candidate  
- Prevent double voting  
- Ability to view total votes for each candidate  

## 🚀 Deployment Steps (Remix + MetaMask)

### 1️⃣ Write the Contract on Remix

- Visit: https://remix.ethereum.org

- Create a new file: Voting.sol

- Paste your contract code

### 2️⃣ Compile the Contract

- Open the Solidity Compiler tab

- Select compiler version 0.8.20 or above

- Click Compile Voting.sol

### 3️⃣ Deploy the Contract (MetaMask Recommended for Bonus)

- Go to Deploy & Run Transactions

- (Bonus) Select environment: Injected Provider – MetaMask

- (Bonus) Switch MetaMask to a test network (Sepolia / Holesky)

- Click Deploy


### ⭐ Bonus Points: Deployment done through MetaMask instead of Remix VM.

### 4️⃣ Copy Your Contract Address

- After deployment, Remix displays your contract address.
- Copy it — you will include it in the GitHub submission.

## 📂 GitHub Submission Instructions

### 1️⃣ Create a Folder Named With Your Roll Number

- Example:

```
   /your-branch-name
        /LCS20250XX
            ├── Voting.sol
            └── contract-address.txt
```


### 2️⃣ Add Required Files

- ✔ Voting.sol

- Your complete smart contract file.

- ✔ contract-address.txt

- Paste only your deployed contract address.

- Example:

- 0x1234abcd5678ef901234abcd5678ef90aabbccdd

### 3️⃣ Raise a Pull Request (PR)

- PR Title Format:

- Added Voting Contract - <Your Roll Number>

- PR Description Must Include:

- Your name

- Your roll number

- Contract address

- Confirmation if deployed via MetaMask (for bonus)
